I wanted to write a shell function that can read from a pipe. I just got that part to work now. The next step is to use a path and take the last part of the path as the link name using sed.


I created the file linkDIr.sh
[code]
#!/bin/sh
linkDirs(){
  $i=0;
  echo "hi"
  while read path; do
    echo "$path";
    out[$i]=$path|sed s/'(^.*)([^/]*)/$'/'<a href="'$path'">'\2'<\a>'/;
  done
  return 1
}
[/code]
I load the function by calling
[code]
source linkDirs.sh
[/code]

I then call it by typing
[code]
echo "test"|( linkDirs )
I get the error
sed: -e expression #1, char 18: unknown option to `s'
