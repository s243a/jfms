This directory contains an example configuration and src2pkg
script for building a package which contains both your kernel
and kernel-modules in one package.

This is probably the easiest way to package kernel and modules
for most users.

The example configuration file is pretty conservative and will
produce a fairly small kernel and 20-30 kernel modules. You can
either start with this config file or substitute your own.

The config file is setup for the 2.6.23.6 kernel. You'll probably
be using some other version, so you'll need to start your
own configuration using one of these and then run 'make oldconfig'
in the sources in order to select/deselect features for a 
later or earlier version.

See the general directions in the directory above this one 
for how to use src2pkg to build a kernel package.

Have fun!
