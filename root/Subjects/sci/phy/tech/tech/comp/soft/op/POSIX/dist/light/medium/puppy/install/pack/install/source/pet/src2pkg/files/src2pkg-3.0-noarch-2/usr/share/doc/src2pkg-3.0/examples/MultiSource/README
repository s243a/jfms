In this directory there are some examples of one way of to build a
package from multiple source archives or tarballs.

The gtktalog example is a pretty good one to use as an example which
you can modify to build other sources. It uses three sources and
builds pretty fast, so it's easy to quickly see how the script works
if you want to change things. The three programs inlcuded in the
example build are not really related -I just chose three small
GTK1 programs that coule be built pretty fast.

The builds in this directory add some extra functions to the regular
src2pkg script which allows you to 'recycle' some of the usual
functions with new variables for building the extra sources. The
extra sources are installed in the main package tree (PKG_DIR)
instead of in their own package tree. Then the script returns to
processing the main package content.

The abiword build is a real example of how/why one might want to
use this method to build a single package from the result of the
builds of more than one source archive.

These scripts are based on an idea and sample implementation
by Tim Goya. As mentioned in the scripts, the extra functions
could be easily incorporated into the main src2pkg functions.
They could be used from within a src2pkg 'extension' as well.
