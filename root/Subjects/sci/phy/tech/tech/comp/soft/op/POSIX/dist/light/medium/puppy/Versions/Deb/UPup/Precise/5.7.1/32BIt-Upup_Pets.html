<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>
Here is a collection of pets that I've downloaded onto my computer that 
is running Precise 5.7.1 (a version of puppylinux), These are not all of
 the packages that I've downloaded. The are simply the first pets that 
I've decided to upload. I have not included (with few exceptions) in 
this list any non-pet package that i've installed or packages I've 
installed via the "puppy Package manager". <br>
<br>
These pets are likely compatible with 32 bit debian/Ubuntu compatible 
versions of puppylinux which are as new or newer than precise 5.7.1. 
This means that they will likely also work on tahrpup and some of them 
should also work on older UPups such as LUPU (slightly older than 
precise). Many will also work on other versions of puppylinux but the 
more foriegn the system is to Precise 5.7.1 the less certainty that I'll
 have about compatibility. <br>

<h3>Part 1. Essential Pets</h3>

<h4>System Info Pet</h4>

The system info is essential if you do not know something importat about
 your system (either software or hardware). For instance, one should 
know something about their processor to know whether a i586 binary or 
i686 binary would work and would be optimal for their system. I have put
 some notes about processors&nbsp; [<a href="file:///root/spot/Freenet/jsite/MySites/root/Subjects/sci/phy/tech/tech/comp/soft/op/POSIX/dist/light/medium/puppy/Versions/Deb/UPup/Precise/5.7.1/SSK@5TUr4ucVSNl723-sKXlawmgtkU69tvfjELFSZsIuhI0,BLNPoimvPlt6ubAO4CmiduKHZMKp1JMvmzSrgVaYOhA,AQACAAE/pearltrees-s243a-2/Subjects/sci/phy/tech/tech/comp/hard/proc/Notes%20on%20Pentium%20Chips.html">1</a>] on freenet, but at this point they are mostly personal notes until I learn more about processors.<br>

<br>

<h3>PupMenu Pet</h3>

The tool PupMenu is essential for troubleshooting problems with 
installing software. It let's you see and edit the command of any given 
menu item and also let's you change the menu category, so that the items
 appear in a different part of the menu. While others have not reported 
this problem sometimes I have personaly found that editing a menu 
category of any given item can corrupt the menu making so that it 
doesn't show. The solution to this is to run the fixmenu script in a 
shell.<br>

<br>

<h4>Python 2.6.4</h4>

<br>

Many applications and even build systems depend on python. For instance 
python is required to install dropbox, or play games through steam 
[][][][]. For some reason version 2 of python seems to be preferred over
 version 3. I am not sure why but there have been major language 
changes between version 2 and 3. People probably stuck with version 2 to
 be back compatible with existing systems. <br>

<br>

<h4>UExtract and dir2pet</h4>

Most versions of puppylinux come with many tools to on compress files. 
However, there are many compression/decompression tools and UExtract is 
the swiss army knife of decompression tools. If you do not have a 
decompression tool or do not know which decompression tool to use 
UExtract will likely be a suitable tool. UExtract comes already 
installed on tahrpup but not on precise. <br>

<br>

Decompression tools are intimately related to tools to build pet 
packages because on many systems there packages (e.g. deb) are simply a 
collection of compressed binaries. While some puppies may be able to 
install some foreign packages without additional software (for instance 
on precise double clicking can install deb files via petget), this is 
not garanteed to be the case. The remedy is to extract the compressed 
file and then convert it to a package via dir2pet. <br>

<br>

<b>pburn</b><br>

<br>

Precise comes with a package called burniso2cd which can be used to burn
 iso files. I have not had much luck getting this program to work, while
 I have had good luck getting pburn to work. Additionally, I have been 
able to use pburn to create mufti-session cds from which I could run 
puppy linux. This is a feet that I have not been able to accomplish on 
any windows iso program I've tried. <br>
<h3>Part 2. Other Important Pets</h3>
<hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
<br>
<h3>speak.pet</h3>
<br>
I use text-to-speech software extensively, so that I am able to listen 
to news articles while doing housework or when editing stuff that I've 
wrote. Speak-1.45.05-i486.pet was the only text to speech software I 
have got working so far on linux. This is most likely be cause I am 
relatively new to linux. It is not the best text to speech software I've
 used but it is easy to install. Another plus is that this package comes
 with some scripts that can be edited which call the speech engine for 
each line of text. The speech engine does not use the best voice and I 
don't know if it has the ability to control the reading speed. The 
biggest weakness is in the script which reads the text. Due to in proper
 escaping of the Astrix character '*', an astrix in the "text file" 
causes each name in the root directory to be read. This would be an easy
 fix. However, until I get around to trying to fix this my solution is 
to do a simple find and replace before passing a text file to the 
script. <br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>PyCAD</h3>
I have not tried this pet out but it is a very small cad program and Cad is very useful in engineering and design type fields. It requires python.<br>

<h3>Part 3. Packages no one probably wants or needs but I've uploaded them just for the Hell of it.</h3>
<hr size="2" width="100%"><br>
<br>
I have uploaded the following package just because. It is optimized for 
an i386 architecture, which is much older than most peoples systems but 
should be compatible with newer&nbsp; systems. I do not know if I 
actually use this package. I do require this package to run octave 
(available via the puppy package manager) but may have downloaded a 
newer version of this library. If anyone is trying to do linear algebra 
calculations on a very very old system then they may find this package 
handy.<br>
