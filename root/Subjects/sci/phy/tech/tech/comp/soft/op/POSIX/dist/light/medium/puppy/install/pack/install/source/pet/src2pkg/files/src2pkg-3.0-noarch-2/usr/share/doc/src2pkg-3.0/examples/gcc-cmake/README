This package has been compiled to install and run from
/usr/gcc-3.4.6 instead of /usr/bin.
This allows you to have multiple compilers available just
by changing your PATH.

To use this compiler instead of the regular compiler in your
PATH, just prepend the path to this compiler to your regular
path:

PATH=/usr/gcc-3.4.6/bin:$PATH

In this directory is a small shell script called GCC346 which you
can place in your path. It will set up the above environment
so you can just give the make command like this:

GCC336 make

You can check to be sure that your path is being setup correctly
by giving the command: `GCC346 which gcc`. This should return:
/usr/gcc-3.4.6/bin/gcc  and not /usr/bin/gcc.

If you need strict linking to the compiler libraries you can also
set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable like this:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/gcc-3.4.6/lib
