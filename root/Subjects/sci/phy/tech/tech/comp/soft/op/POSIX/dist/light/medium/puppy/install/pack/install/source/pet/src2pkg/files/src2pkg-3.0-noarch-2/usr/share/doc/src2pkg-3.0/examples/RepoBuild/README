To quickly see how easy this example can be, simply:
1. copy the two files URL-list.txt and src2pkg.RepoBuild into
any directory where you have write privileges.
2. make sure your internet connection is up
3. cd into the new directory
4. run the command 'bash ./src2pkg.RepoBuild'

The above will download the sources for three small utilities,
compile them and create packages of them. All in just a few minutes

The src2pkg.RepoBuild is extensively commented. Read through it
to see how to change the behaviour of the script.

See additional notes about this example in the README.examples
file one level up from here.
