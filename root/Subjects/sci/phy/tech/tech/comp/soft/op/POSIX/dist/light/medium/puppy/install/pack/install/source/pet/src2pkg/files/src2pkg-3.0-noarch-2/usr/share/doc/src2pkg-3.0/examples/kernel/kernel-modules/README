This directory contains an example configuration and src2pkg
build script for producing a kernel-modules package which is
separate from the kernel package -the same as the
standard Slackware packaging method.

The config file found here is the same as for producing the
standard Slackware kernel-modules-smp-2.6.24.5 package.
You may be using some other version, so you'll need to start your
own configuration using this one and then run 'make oldconfig'
in the sources in order to select/deselect features for a 
later or earlier version. Then copy the resulting hidden '.config'
file to this directory and name it config-modules-mine or
other suitable name.
The rc.modules file for kernel-2.6.24.5 is also included here.

See the general directions in the directory above this one 
for how to use src2pkg to build a kernel package.

Have fun!
