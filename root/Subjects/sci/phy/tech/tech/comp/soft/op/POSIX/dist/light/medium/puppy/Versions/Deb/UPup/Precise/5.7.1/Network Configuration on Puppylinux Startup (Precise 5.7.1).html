</span>In the above thread the following hint was given by <span class="name"><b>amigo</b>
to look for where a given function is called.</span><br>

I'm doing this because I want to control the dns name server settings 
that are configured during startup. The primary tool that I wish to use 
is called DNSCrypt (See <a href="http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=98782">thread</a>).<br>

I'm quite new to linux so perhaps my question seem silly to the pros. <br>
