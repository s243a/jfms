# wrapper script for alternate compiler
# to compile software with this compiler just issue the command:
# 'GCC346 make'
PATH=/usr/gcc-3.4.6/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/usr/gcc-3.4.6/lib/gcc-lib/i486-slackware-linux/3.4.6:$PATH

# this doesn't seem to be necessary
# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/gcc-3.4.6/lib

# if you want to see that a different path is being used, uncomment this:
# echo "using alternate path: $PATH

# execute whatever command was given -like 'make' or 'make install'
exec "$@"
