Thanks and formal credits are due to many people for their contibutions
to src2pkg, since its' inception (as pkgBuild) in late 2004:

* Tim Goya <tuxdev103@gmail.com>
Many thanks to Tim Goya for his active interest in src2pkg, contribution
of ideas, bits of code and suggestions. In 2009, Tim released the first
public beta-version of a tool called src2pkg-ng which is based on some
of the ideas and concepts used by src2pkg. I have returned the favor to
Tim by making some suggestions which have, hopefully, helped him avoid
some of the short-comings and difficult transitions which src2pkg has
undergone over the years.

* Pieter Sartain <pesartain@googlemail.com
Thanks to Pieter for setting up and hosting the src2pkg wiki at: src2pkg.net
Piete has also provided valuable ideas, feedback and encouragement.

* Drew Ames <jxa127@verizon.net>
Drew has long been an avid tester and promoter of src2pkg, having authored
a review of src2pkg for linux.com. Drew is also responsible for much of the
work of creating and maintaining the src2pkg wiki at src2pkg.net

* Many people have provided valuable suggestions, testing and feedback - most
of them via the Slackware forum on linuxquestions.org. But src2pkg is also
used by folks running distros such as Vector Linux, Zenwalk and others, who
have sent emails or responed to posting on the distro's forums.
Most of these occasions of bug-spotting or nice suggestions are credited
in the src2pkg ChangeLog as they are too numerous to mention here.

* Formal Credits *
Over the years, src2pkg has borrowed a few lines of code or ideas from
various sources. Usually, but not always, the code has been substantially
re-written to better fit with the rest of the src2pkg code.

Probably the first such code was parts of the links-creation code borrowed
from the official Slackware 'makepkg' tool which is:

Some ideas have also come from:

src2pkg uses 'libsentry' a forked version of the installwatch library called
which is part of the checkinstall distribution. See further details
about the fork in the src2pkg documentation.
At one time, src2pkg included code taken from checkinstall which had
its' origins in the rpm package manager tool. However, the code was completely
removed long ago.

* I have also reviewed other packaging software at times and may have picked
up other ideas or concepts from studying their code, the origin of which I no
longer remember. Some projects have served more as an example of how *not*
to do things, so they are better left un-mentioned here.

* If you see code in src2pkg which you think should rightly be credited to you
and it has not been credited here or in the ChangeLog, please contact me and 
let me know so that I can include your name (and Copyright info, if any) in 
this CREDITS file.
