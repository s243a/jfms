A collection of simplemind mindmaps ".smmx" extension and linux source code.

The purpose is to document puppylinux
https://github.com/s243a/test/tree/master/root/Subjects/sci/phy/tech/tech/comp/soft/op/POSIX/dist/light/medium/puppy/file

and linux in general.

This is not an official puppylinux project.


The mindmaps are linked together but probably have to be put in the same file path. Example:
Dropbox/root/Subjects/sci/phy/tech/tech/comp/soft/op/POSIX/
