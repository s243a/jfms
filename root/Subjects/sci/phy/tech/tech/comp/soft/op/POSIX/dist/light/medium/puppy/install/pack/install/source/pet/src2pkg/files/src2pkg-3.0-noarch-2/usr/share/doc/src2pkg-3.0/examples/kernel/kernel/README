This directory contains an example configuration file and src2pkg
build script for reproducing the standard Slackware huge-smp kernel.
This config file is the same as used for the standard Slackware
kernel-2.6.24.5-huge-smp package.

You may be using some other version, so you'll need to start your
own configuration using this file and then run 'make oldconfig'
in the sources in order to select/deselect features for a 
later or earlier version. Then copy the resulting hidden '.config'
file to this directory and name it config-huge-smp-mine or
other suitable name.

See the general directions in the directory above this one 
for how to use src2pkg to build a kernel package.

Have fun!
