The sounds included here come from a couple of different sources.

These come from the freedesktop.org sound-theme package:
bell.ogg		(success)
complete-media-burn.ogg	(success)
suspend-error.ogg	(failure or cancel)

These come from the WSoundServer package:
DefaultBoing.wav	(cancel)
DefaultCrapOut.wav	(ouch)
DefaultError.wav	(failure or cancel)
DefaultKaboom.wav	(ouch or failure)
DefaultOhNo.wav		(ouch or failure)
DefaultOuch.wav		(ouch or failure)

These come via the gamine-0.0.1 package:
plick.ogg		(success) (bell sound) (orig from gcompris)
bonus.wav		(success) (hoohoo sound)
receive.wav		(success) (piano) (orig from gaim)

If you want to change the sound 'theme' you can try some of the
different sounds here or use other sounds of your choosing.
These four sound 'events' are used by src2pkg:
success, failure, cancel and ouch
The name of each event is simply a symlink to the appropriate
sound for the event. To change the sound used for an event,
simply remove the existing symlink and create a new one linking
to the new sound you want to use.
